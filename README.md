## Usage

You can download and run the game using the nix package manager

```bash
nix run github:Zebreus/dragonvoid
```

The arena mode is less unfinished then the main game, you can launch that using:

```bash
nix run github:Zebreus/dragonvoid#arena
```

## Other files

The `jar` is the only file I still have from that project all build scripts are missing. At least the sourcecode and all resources are bundled inside there. Also there are some UML diagrams.
